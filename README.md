## Description
> Study Grouper is an app designed to help students find local study groups and tutors in their area for whatever course or topic they're learning about. Users would be able to create a chat room for their study group that other users can search for and join. The study group's creator would be able to set a location for the group to meet that other users in the study group would be able to see in a map view. The primary motivation for the app is to help students in similar studies connect with each other and hopefully boost their grades as a result.
